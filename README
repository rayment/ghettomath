ghettomath - The worst math library you will ever use

-----------------------------------------------------

ghettomath is a math library. It is perhaps the worst math library you will ever
use. It is so bad, it uses only + - * / // operators for everything, including
logical comparisons. Because of this, math functions have many conditions of use
use to avoid issues such as divide by zero.
